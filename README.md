# Bulk Vegetable/Fruit Ordering Platform

## Overview

This project is a **Bulk Vegetable/Fruit Ordering Platform** where **buyers** can browse available products, place bulk orders, and track their order status. **Admins** can manage orders and inventory. The platform uses a full-stack approach with React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, along with PostgreSQL for the database.

## Features

### For Buyers:
1. **Browse Vegetables/Fruits:**
   - Display a catalog of vegetables and fruits with basic details like name and price per unit.
   - No stock tracking is required (assume all items are available).

2. **Place Orders:**
   - Buyers can place bulk orders by specifying the vegetable/fruit, the desired quantity, and delivery details (name, contact information, and address).
   - Orders should be saved with a unique identifier.

3. **Order Tracking:**
   - Buyers can track the status of their orders:
     - **Pending**: Order has been received.
     - **In Progress**: Order is being processed for delivery.
     - **Delivered**: Order has been delivered.

### For Admins:
1. **Order Management:**
   - Admins can view all placed orders with details about the buyer, delivery address, and ordered items.
   - Admins can update the status of the order (Pending → In Progress → Delivered).

2. **Inventory Management:**
   - Admins can add, edit, or remove vegetables/fruits from the catalog.
   - No stock tracking is required (assume all products are always available).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (or Next.js)
- **Backend:** Express.js (or Flask) for API routes
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon.tech or Dockerized Postgres)
- **UI Styling:** TailwindCSS (for clean and responsive design)
- **Authentication:** Optional (can be added later for admin login)
